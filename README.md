# Wine Analysis

The original .csv contained 130k reviewed wines with the following columns: country, description, designation, points, price, province, region_1, region_2, taster_name, taster_twitter_handle, title, variety, winery. In this analysis, I looked at the country of origin, points, price, and variety. The other variables were simply too varied to make any meaningful visualizations.
