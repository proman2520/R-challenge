# Wine Analysis



Installs necessary:
R: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

Still to do:
1. Fix visuals and optimize the visualizations (is it the best way of showing the information?).
2. Write README Analysis.
3. Revise code for efficiency and consistency; add comments.
4. Output single-value aggregates and dataframe heads alongside the improved visualizations.
